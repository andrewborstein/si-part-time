				<h3>Get Comfortable </h3>
				<p class="step">Sit in a meditation posture, whatever is most comfortable for you. </p>

				<h3>Warm Up </h3>
				<p class="step">Inhale deeply. Really draw the breath in until you feel a slight pressure from inside your chest on your solar plexus. Hold this for a moment and then exhale completely. Push the air out as much as you can. Hold this for a moment. Repeat this warm up round 15 times.
				</p>

				<h3>Power Breaths</h3>
				<p class="step">Inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth in short but powerful bursts. The belly is pulled inward when you are breathing out and is pulled outward when you are breathing in. Keep a steady pace and use your midriff fully. Close your eyes and do this around 30 times or until you feel your body is saturated with oxygen. </p>

				<h3>Scan Your Body</h3>
				<p class="step">During the 30 power breaths, delve into your body and become aware of it as possible. Trace your awareness up and down your body and use your intuition as to what parts lack energy and what parts are overflowing.</p>

				<h3>Hold</h3>
				<p class="step">After the the 30 rapid succession of breath cycles, draw the breath in once more and fill the lungs to maximum capacity without using too much force. Then push all of the air out and hold for as long as you can. Really relax and open all energy channels in your body. </p>

				<p class="quote">It is not the critic who counts;<span> not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, </span> because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; <span> but who does actually strive to do the deeds;who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.
