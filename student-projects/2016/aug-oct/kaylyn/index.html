        <h1>Synchro-Sym Technologies</h1>
        <p> Providing "real innovation for our clean and sustainable energy future," Best Electric Machine (BEM) is an electrical infrastructure technology company, which is a funded subsidiary of Engineering Devices Incorporated, which is a privately held Massachusetts company that has been serving the high tech industry since 1978. Our Mission statement is, "Real Innovation For Our Energy Future!" </p>
        <p>By simple enabling of integrated compact synchro-phasor, frequency changer, frequency synchronizer, power-factor correcting, electric drive, and electric propulsion systems of any power rating, BEM expects the patented technologies will bring the so-called smart grid closer to practical reality.</p>

              <p class="read-more-wrap"><i class="fa fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> The only one-step solid state transformer (SST) [1] type converter, called Brushless Multiphase Self-Commutation Control (BMSCC) but also known as Brushless Real-Time Emulation Control (BRTEC) that directly converts single phase or multiple phase Alternating Current (AC) of any frequency, phase or voltage to (or from) any frequency, phase, or voltage AC or Direct Current (DC) or even DC to (or from) DC <span class="read-more-target">with virtually no harmonic content, without the bulk, cost and inefficiencies of DC-Link Stages, extraneous active power correction, or low frequency reactive components. Uniquely, BMSCC uses a position-dependent-flux high frequency transformer, which shares power between phases to at least eliminate the DC Link Stage or to automatically provide speed synchronized multiphase power in real time for self-commutated control of electric motors and generators (i.e., electric machines (EM));[2]</span></p>
