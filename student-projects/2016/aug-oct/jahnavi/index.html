				<h2>My Very First Satirical Fashion Blog Post</h2>
				<p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.<br>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</br><br>But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</br><br>Abraham Lincoln</br><br>November 19, 1863</p>

				<p>Salt and Vinnies is a blog started by Jahnavi Bhangley, a woman with way too much time on her hands who needed an outlet to share her superfluous, often-never-shared musings. While deciding on what to name her blog, she asked a good friend, "What is a good kind of random name for a blog?"<br><br>Her friend replied. "How about 'Salt and Vinnies?'"</br><br> "Oh, interesting," Jahnavi mused. "What inspired you come up with that?"</br><br>"I don't know, I was just looking at my bag of salt and vinegar almonds."</br><br>And so, a blog was born.</br><br>Jahnavi lives in the New England area, enjoys long walks across the Charles when it's frozen over, pumpkin everything (because apparently that's what you have to do in New England)and hates to live, laugh and love. This was written by the third person to give the illusion that she is so important that she can hire a team to write this for her.</p>
